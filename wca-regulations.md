### WCA Regulations

The WCA Regulations contain the full set of Regulations that apply to all official competitions sanctioned by the World Cube Association.
Previously, from the January 1st, 2013 release until the January 1st, 2025 release, the WCA Regulations were split into the WCA Regulations and the WCA Guidelines. The former contents of both documents were combined into the WCA Regulations for the DATE, 2025 release.

### Wording
Uses of the words "must", "must not", "should", "should not" and "may" match [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## <article-1><officials><officials> Article 1: Officials

- 1a) A competition must include a WCA Delegate and an organization team (consisting of one or more individuals) with the following officials: judges, scramblers and score takers.
- 1b) The organization team of a competition is responsible for logistics before, during, and after the competition.
- 1c) The WCA Delegate is responsible for ensuring that the competition adheres to the WCA Regulations and any applicable WCA policies or requirements. The WCA Delegate may appoint other members of the organization team to carry out specific responsibilities on their behalf, but is ultimately accountable for how these responsibilities are carried out.
- 1c+) [CLARIFICATION] If there are multiple WCA Delegates designated for the competition, "the WCA Delegate" refers to any of them. "The WCA Delegate" also refers to anyone appointed by a designated WCA Delegate for a relevant responsibility of the WCA Delegate for the competition.
- 1c++) [CLARIFICATION] WCA Delegates may attend the competition without being designated to serve in the WCA Delegate role for the competition. "The WCA Delegate" does not refer to them unless they have been appointed with a relevant responsibility by a designated WCA Delegate for the competition (see [Regulation 1c+](regulations:regulation:1c+)).
- 1e) Each event must have one or more judges.
    - 1e1) A judge is responsible for executing the procedures of the event.
        - 1e1a) A judge may judge multiple competitors simultaneously at the discretion of the WCA Delegate, as long as the judge is able to ensure that all WCA Regulations are followed at all times.
    - 1e2) Every competitor must be available for judging. If required to judge, a competitor may be excused only for a legitimate reason (e.g. being unfamiliar with a puzzle), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification from an event, multiple events, or all events at that competition (see [Regulation 2k](regulations:regulation:2k)).
- 1f) Each event must have one or more scramblers. Exception: 3x3x3 Fewest Moves.
    - 1f1) A scrambler applies scramble sequences to prepare puzzles for attempts (see [Regulation A2](regulations:regulation:A2)).
    - 1f2) Every competitor must be available for scrambling. If required to scramble, a competitor may be excused only for a legitimate reason (e.g. being unfamiliar with scrambling notation), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. Penalty: disqualification from an event, multiple events, or all events at that competition (see [Regulation 2k](regulations:regulation:2k)).
- 1g) Each event must have one or more score takers.
    - 1g1) A score taker is responsible for compiling results.
    - 1g2) Changes to the result on a score sheet are only permitted at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 1h) Competitors in the same round of an event may compete as a single group or be divided into multiple groups.
- 1h+) [RECOMMENDATION] Competitors in the same group should use the same scramble sequences. Different groups should use different scramble sequences.
- 1h++) [RECOMMENDATION] All attempts in the final round of an event, as well as all 3x3x3 Fewest Moves attempts, should have the same scramble sequences for all competitors (i.e. only 1 group).
- 1h+++) [ADDITION] Competitors may request to compete at a time different to the scheduled time for the round in a separate group. The WCA Delegate should carefully consider the fairness and practicality of the situation before approving any such requests, and must ensure that such attempts follow [Regulation 9l](regulations:regulation:9l) (i.e. they must start after all competitors have finished their attempts from any previous round of the same event, and finish before any competitor has started an attempt for any following round of the same event). Competitors requesting such accommodations should contact the organization team and WCA Delegate before the competition. Exception: such accommodations are not permitted for 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, which specifies its own limited accommodations in [Regulation E6](regulations:regulation:E6).
    - 1h1) Scramblers and judges for a round must not scramble for/judge competitors in their own group before they have finished all of their attempts for the round. The following exceptions apply:
        - 1h1a) For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, judges may judge competitors in their own group before they have finished their attempt (i.e. while they are competing).
        - 1h1a+) [CLARIFICATION] Judges who are competing in a 3x3x3 Fewest Moves attempt they are judging must not begin grading attempts until they have finished their own attempt. They may begin grading before the end of the 60 minutes if they have submitted their attempt early (see [Regulation E2b+](regulations:regulation:E2b+)). They should get another judge to grade their own attempt.
        - 1h1b) For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, competitors may judge other competitors in their own group after they have finished their attempt.
- 1j) All officials may compete in the competition.
- 1k) Officials may serve multiple roles (e.g. organization team, WCA Delegate, judge, score taker, scrambler).
